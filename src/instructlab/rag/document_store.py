"""
A module to define interfaces to manage document stores:
- Ingest documents in it. This typically involves creating the document embeddings through a configured embedding model.
- Query the stored documents for an augmented RAG context. Advanced retrieval techniques can be used to improve the reliabiliyty of
the generated context.

        Retrieve documents from the actual store matching the given `user_query` and compute the augmented context to be used

        Params:
          user_query: The original user query.

        Ingest documents from the `input_dir` location to the document store.
        Params:
          input_dir: The folder containing user documents (exploration is not recursive). The assumption is that these documents have been
          processed using instructlab-sdg processing functions, based on docling, and are in JSON format.
